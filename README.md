### 1. Adonet Customer Application (ADO.NET)
Using ADO.NET, customer, city and statistics information is dynamically pulled from SQL database. The purpose of the application is to ensure efficient data processing.

### 2. Product Managment Application (Entity Framework - Database First)
Product and category management was done using Entity Framework's Database First approach. Database objects are automatically mapped to .NET objects.

### 3. Statistical Data Representation (Entity Framework)
The data in the created tables were processed with LINQ queries and statistical reports were created. The querying power of Entity Framework was emphasized.

### 4. Movie and TV Series List Application (Entity Framework - Code First)
Using Entity Framework's Code First approach, a database was created and a movie/series list management system was developed.

### 5. Northwind Database Operations (Dapper ORM)
Data operations were performed with Dapper ORM using the Northwind database. This project focuses on lightweight and efficient data access methods.

### 6. Weather API Application (ASP.NET Core)
An API has been developed using ASP.NET Core to provide weather data for cities and towns. A scalable and well documented API structure is presented.

### 7. Using API Data in a Console Application (C#)
Data was extracted from the developed weather API and used in the C# console application.

#### 8. Exchange Rate Application (Rapid API)
Instant exchange rates (Dollar, Euro, Pound) were captured and dynamically displayed via Rapid API.

### 9. Order Management Application (MongoDB)
An order management system was developed using MongoDB. NoSQL database integration and document-based data storage processes are demonstrated in this project.

### 10. ToDo List Application (PostgreSQL)
A ToDo List application was developed using PostgreSQL database. CRUD operations were performed successfully.

### 11. SQL Trigger Application
Some database operations are automated by using parameterized and non-parameterized triggers in SQL.

### 12. JWT Authentication Application
Session management and authentication processes were performed using JSON Web Token (JWT). Token based authentication was successfully performed.

### 13. Air Card Application (Rapid API)
Instant weather data retrieved from Rapid API was visualized and presented as a weather card application.

### 14. SQL Relationship Management Application
Database relationships were structured using one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships on SQL.

### 15. Fuel Price Simulation (Istanbul)
Current fuel prices in Istanbul were taken and a fuel simulation was created.

### 16. User Activation Application
Activation codes were sent to the real e-mail addresses of the users and session verification was performed through these codes.

### 17. Kaggle Data Analysis Application
Data analysis was performed using Kaggle data sets (Netflix, pizza orders, market data) and an application on big data management was developed.

### 18. Dashboard and Chart Application (C# Forms)
A dashboard was created using C# Forms, dynamic graphics and widgets were prepared with Kaggle data sets.

### 19. Restaurant Table Management System
The instant occupancy and vacancy status of the tables of a restaurant was monitored and this information was visualized in a management interface.

### 20. Final
A general evaluation was made in the final section.
